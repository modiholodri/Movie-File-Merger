# Installation

There are several other programs used together with MFM.  All other programs can be downloaded and used for free.  For detailed information about the installation of third party programs please consult the according documentation.

## MFM Installation
Working with Dropbox is part of the current design of the program.  However the program can also work standalone, like from a memory stick or normal folder on the hard disk without Dropbox.  It is recommended to copy the whole folder that contains the executable and support files into a new folder, as the program when working will create the 2 ‘Collection’ folders on the same level as its own folder.  In this way it is easy to keep track of all the files that the program uses.

Double clicking on the program in its folder or starting it from a shortcut is all you need to do run it.  No further installation needed.

### System Requirements
MFM runs under Windows XP*, Vista*, Windows 7, and Windows 8.  MFM has also been used on a Mac with Parallels installed.

* Not tested, and needs .net framework 4.0 installed.  To handle the resizing of the windows, a program like PowerResizer is required.

## TeraCopy Installation
You can find more information about TeraCopy on http://codesector.com/teracopy.  TeraCopy is designed to copy and move files at the maximum possible speed. It skips bad files during the copying process, and then displays them at the end of the transfer so that you can see which ones need attention. TeraCopy can automatically check the copied files for errors by calculating their CRC checksum values. It also provides a lot more information about the files being copied than its Windows counterpart. TeraCopy integrates with Windows Explorer's right-click menu and can be set as the default copy handler.

MFM uses TeraCopy to do the actual copying or moving.

Install TeraCopy with the default settings and change them later as shown below if wanted.
To make sure TeraCopy all the time starts copying, uncheck “Check Free Space” in the Preferences.  You can open the Preferences by right clicking somewhere in the TeraCopy window and selecting Preferences...
If you do not want that TeraCopy replaces the operating system copy function, uncheck Use TeraCopy as Default Copy Handler.

## Dropbox Installation
You can download Dropbox from https://www.dropbox.com/install2.  To use Dropbox you will have to register your own Dropbox account.  If you recommend Dropbox for other people you will get 500 MB more, if the other user is new to Dropbox and installs the Dropbox program on a computer.

## GOM Installation
You can download GOM Media Player from http://player.gomlab.com/eng.
Disable the option Default Playback Windows Size so that GOM Media Player will only take up the right side of your screen.  You will have to move GOM there “manually”; it does not work to drag GOM there on the title bar to resize it to half of the screen.
